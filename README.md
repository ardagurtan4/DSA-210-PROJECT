##SPOTIFY MUSIC AND PRODUCTIVITY ANALYSIS

#Project Idea and Overview

The goal of this project is to analyze the effect of music on work productivity. Using Spotify's API, we will collect data about the songs I listen to during work, study sessions and examine how different music genres or features (tempo, energy, etc.) impact my productivity. I will check whether listening to music during studying helps me or not and which music genres is more efficient and helpful for concentraiton and completing tasks.

#Data

The data will be collected from the Spotify API, which will include song features such as tempo, energy, genre, and others. In addition, personal work data, such as the amount of time spent working and the number of tasks completed, will also be recorded.

#Project Plan

Data Collection: Use the Spotify API to gather song data, record study time and efficiency day by day.
Data Analysis: Analyze the relationship between music features (e.g., tempo, energy) and productivity (e.g., task completion time).
Visualization: Create graphs to visualize trends and insights.

#Tools:

Spotify API for data collection
Python libraries( Pandas, Mathplotlib, Seaborn for data analysis and visualization

#Goal

My goal in this project is basically to uncover insights on how music affects work productivity. By analyzing different music genres and their features, I aim to identify the most effective types of music for different work tasks. The expected outcome is to determine whether specific music genres improve focus, reduce stress, and increase overall productivity during work.
